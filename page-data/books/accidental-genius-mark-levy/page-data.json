It's in its second edition and was recommended as a must read business book for 2020 in an article on Flipboard.</p>\n<p>Accidental Genius has added a new dimension to my life!</p>\n<p>Levy describes a discipline he calls <em>free writing</em>. <em>Free writing</em> is when you simply start writing on a topic of your choice and don't stop or pause for 30 minutes. Your articulation, grammar and spelling all don’t matter! <em>Free writing</em> is all about not allowing your pen to stop moving for 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>I have now done about ten <em>free writing</em> sessions and have been amazed by the thoughts, ideas and solutions hidden deep in my subconscious brain that I might never have surfaced if it was not for <em>free writing</em>!</p>\n<p>So while you are hanging around at home bored and wondering what to watch next on television, I challenge you to grab a pen and paper. Set a timer for 30 minutes and don’t stop writing until your timer goes off.</p>\n<p>You will be amazed by the great ideas that <em>free writing</em> will surface from your subconscious brain!</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to start? How about writing for 30 minutes non-stop on, “Why am I so bored at home and what can I do about it?”</p>\n<p>I hope the discipline of <em>free writing</em> will surface ideas from your subconscious brain that amaze you as much as my <em>free writing</em> output has amazed me. Enjoy!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Accidental Genius by Mark Levy","type":"books","video":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/books/accidental-genius-mark-levy/"}}}
