Please check it out at <a href=\"https://karmaincrisis.com\" target=\"_new\">https://karmaincrisis.com</a> and follow its advice to support your favorite cafes, restaurants or other small businesses. Please also share it via the links on the site to further support small businesses around the world.</p>\n<p>When cycling last weekend I past a friend who runs a local cafe together with his wife called <a href=\"https://www.petitonoordwijk.nl/over-petito/\" target=\"_new\">Petito</a>. During my ride I was thinking about the difficult times cafes and other small businesses are experiencing and wondering how I could help. My wife and I enjoy going out for coffee and due to the shutdown that is no longer possible. So I thought why wouldn't I donate what I normally spend in a cafe the next time I have a coffee at home and thereby help my favorite cafe survive!</p>\n<p>This is a small gesture, but if we all do this then it could have an impact all over the world and therefore I built <a href=\"https://karmaincrisis.com\" target=\"_new\">https://karmaincrisis.com</a> to help spread the word and try to achieve this goal. If you think this is a good idea, please share <a href=\"https://karmaincrisis.com\" target=\"_new\">https://karmaincrisis.com</a> on your social networks.</p>\n<p>In many countries people are not familiar with Paypal and the easy and secure payment method it provides. All you need in order to donate money to someone is their email address. On <a href=\"https://karmaincrisis.com\" target=\"_new\">https://karmaincrisis.com</a> I provide a brief description how Paypal works and share relevant links for those of you new to Paypal.</p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://karmaincrisis.com\" target=\"_new\">https://karmaincrisis.com</a> is only available in English, Dutch and German. If you'd like to see it in your language too then please copy the site into a Word document, translate it and email me the translation.</p>\n<p>Thank you and stay healthy.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Karma in Crisis","type":"blogs","date":"12 Apr 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blogs/20200412-karma-in-crisis/"}}}
