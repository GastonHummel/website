Can a manager manage without leading? When we think of iconic leaders of our time like Steve Jobs, few would debate his leadership skills but what about his management skills?</p>\n<p>For me the key difference between leadership and management is that you cannot be a leader if you don’t have followers. Followers follow a leader voluntarily out of respect and admiration for what the leader has achieved, has created or how the leader makes us feel about ourselves.</p>\n<p>We never follow a leader due to their job title or rank. However, we might occasionally find ourselves in situations where we must follow requests and instructions from a manager because of their job title or rank. But how many organisations have achieved breakthrough success and changed the world using hierarchical management structures without having creative leaders in place?</p>\n<p>In today’s rapidly changing world, it’s more critical than ever to have creative leaders who inspire creativity in their associates towards achieving a common goal.</p>\n<p>In order to create a truly authentic following and become an authentic leader we need to be true to ourselves and output creative work that we are passionate about. Work that feels like it is aligned with our inner calling. Because if the work we deliver is not aligned with what we feel in our gut, then how can we ever hope for it to light a fire in somebody else’s belly and make them want to follow our work and become collaborators towards our goals?</p>\n<p>Particularly in the gig-economy it is critical to develop creative output that we are passionate about and that we share it to build a tribe of like-minded people who will collaborate with us on achieving goals that outsize us as individuals.</p>\n<p>Reid Hoffman the founder of LinkedIn says, “Everyone is working on their hero story about their hero journey and the impact they had or will have on the world.” He recommends that when looking to achieve our own goals we must think about how to involve others. And more importantly, determine how we can help others create their own hero stories by helping us achieve ours!</p>\n<p>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, uses empathy as the cornerstone of his leadership. In his book, “Hit Refresh”, he describes his passion for understanding how colleagues and customers see their world and their goals. And about his and Microsoft’s mission of empowering people to achieve their goals. When I see some of the great free tools, like VS Code, that Microsoft has released to the world, and I use daily for my own creative endeavours, I believe that his mission comes from the heart and is more than just marketing!</p>\n<p>Arguably the first leader was a creator. Someone who showed up and persevered to create something that people admire and therefore seek to follow its creator who thereby becomes a leader with followers!</p>\n<p>I have come to believe that this is the starting point for anyone wanting to become a great leader. That is to establish a creative practice, show up daily and persevere on creative projects that we are passionate about and to regularly share our creative work. Also, to become to others, the follower we wish we had.</p>\n<p>Everyone struggles with the willingness to value as-yet-unmade-work. That’s why uncreated works of personal expression are at the top of everyone’s bucket list right up until we die. Think for a moment of an item that you value greatly. An item you hugely appreciate. It might be a device, a favourite painting, a book or a favourite song. Now think of that item’s creator and their state of mind when they were just starting to create your favourite work of art. Think how easily they could have become distracted to do something more urgent in the moment but far less important than creating your favourite piece of art? Great leaders recognize that what’s important is rarely urgent and what’s urgent is rarely important!</p>\n<p>That is why I believe it is critical to have a daily creative practice. To have the discipline to persevere and share our work. To be to others the follower we wish we had. And develop the empathy and leadership skills to be able to enlist others on our creative projects by figuring out how to make them the hero in their own hero’s journey by helping us realise ours.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"9221d351-26f2-5010-a463-21174df9eafa","frontmatter":{"title":"The Impact of Wheat on Our Health","date":"30 Jul 2019","video":"26rUEVT48jQ","svg":"/wheat.png"},"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/20190730-the-impact-of-wheat-on-our-health/"},"excerpt":"1% of the global population suffers from celiac disease – often referred to as a gluten allergy.

In 1965, 4% of the US population had a chronic disease. Today 46% of US children have been diagnosed with a chronic disease.</p>\n<p>For the first time in America’s history, children’s life expectancy is a generation shorter than that of their parents!</p>\n<p>Why? The secret might lie in how wheat has changed since it was first consumed around thirty-five-hundred BC.</p>\n<p>The original wheat was Einkorn wheat. It had the simplest genetic code of all wheat, containing only 14 chromosomes. Soon Einkorn combined with an unrelated grass called Goat-grass. Goat-grass added its genetic code to Einkorn resulting in the more complex Emmer wheat that has 28 chromosomes.</p>\n<p>When humans mate, Dad’s 46 chromosomes mix with Mum’s 46 chromosomes giving their children a total of 46 chromosomes too. But some plants like wheat get the total sum of their parents’ chromosomes.</p>\n<p>Sometime before Christ, Emmer wheat with its 28 chromosomes, crossed with another grass called Triticum Tauschii, yielding the first 42 chromosome wheat called Triticum Aestivum. Triticum Aestivum is genetically the closest to today’s wheat!</p>\n<p>Today Einkorn, Emmer and Triticum Aestivum have been replaced by thousands of human-bred offspring of Triticum Aestivum. The Triticum wheat of today is the product of breeding to generate high yields along with drought and heat resistance. In fact, wheat has been modified so much that modern wheat cannot survive in the wild without support from nitrate fertilizers and pest control.</p>\n<p>When large quantities of nitrate fertilizer are applied to wheat fields, the seed head at the top of the plant grows to enormous proportions. The top-heavy seed head buckles the stalk killing the plant.</p>\n<p>Around 1960, Norman Borlaug developed an exceptionally high-yielding wheat called dwarf wheat. It is shorter and stockier, allowing the wheat to resist buckling under the large seed head.</p>\n<p>Dr Borlaug’s dwarf wheat solved many of the world’s hunger problems. For example, in China it increased the wheat crop production eightfold between 1961 and 1999! Today 99% of all wheat is dwarf wheat and dwarf wheat also won Dr Borlaug a Nobel prize!</p>\n<p>When wheats are combined to create new wheat variants, 95% of the proteins in the offspring are the same as those in the parents but 5% are unique and found in neither parent! Especially Gluten proteins undergo considerable change when wheats are combined. In one experiment, 14 brand new gluten proteins were identified in the offspring that were not present in either of the wheat parents!</p>\n<p>That’s why, when compared to century old wheat types, modern dwarf wheat contains more gluten proteins – the cause of celiac disease and gluten allergies!</p>\n<p>Today scientists can insert and remove single wheat genes to create wheat that is disease resistant, pesticide resistant and survive in different temperatures!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, new wheats can be genetically tailored to be compatible with specific fertilisers and pesticides. This has become huge business for chemical producers like Cargill and Monsanto. Both sell patented seeds along with their associated fertilisers and pesticides. One of these fertilizers is called glyphosate and sold under the name Roundup.</p>\n<p>Glyphosate tolerant crops are often called Roundup Ready. They are genetically bred to allow farmers to freely spray the weed killer Roundup without harming the crop.</p>\n<p>Monsanto originally patented Glyphosate as an antibiotic. In the same way that antibiotics kill our healthy gut bacteria, Glyphosate has killed most of the healthy bacteria in the top layers of US soil turning it into infertile dust that can no longer grow crops naturally. All that can be grown are genetically modified Roundup Ready crops so long as they are sprayed with plenty of Glyphosate!</p>\n<p>Worryingly, test animals fed Roundup Ready soybeans show alterations in liver, pancreatic, intestinal and testicular tissue compared to animals fed conventional soybeans! Furthermore, in the US, today the life expectancy is up to 20 years shorter in agricultural areas due to their increased exposure to Glyphosate!</p>\n<p>When you think of all the differences between men and women that originate from just one of our 46 chromosomes being different, it is questionable if the modern 42 chromosome dwarf wheat, ancient 28 chromosome Emmer wheat and even older 14 chromosome Einkorn should all be called Wheat!</p>\n<p>The insights in this blog post are from the excellent Wheat Belly book by cardiologist William Davis and the <a href=\"https://farmersfootprint.us\">https://farmersfootprint.us</a> website by Dr Zach Bush that seeks to raise funds to regenerate 5 million acres of US farmland by 2025.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"099e5b99-2e2c-5986-9353-b55b672e8457","frontmatter":{"title":"Eating for the Long Run","date":"09 Jul 2019","video":"XJdclOXrqSc","svg":"/run.png"},"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/20190709-eating-for-the-long-run/"},"excerpt":"In 1986, at the age of 42, my mother died of cancer.

On the next day I started running and have run\nalmost every day for the last 33 years. The reason I run is the hope that it will save me from my\nmother’s fate at such a young age. In my mid-forties I started wondering what else I can do to\nmaximise my chances of living another 50 healthy years.</p>\n<p>And then I stumbled across 3 excellent books, the first being The Longevity Diet by Dr Valter Longo\nwhich describes how to eat to maximise our healthy lifespan. His research is based on five pillars:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Basic research – that is doing tests on yeast and mice</li>\n<li>Epidemiology – the study of the distribution of health and disease conditions in defined\npopulations</li>\n<li>Clinical studies –the testing of the hypotheses from basic research and epidemiology in\ncontrolled trials on randomised populations</li>\n<li>Centenarian studies – the study of how people live in areas that have the largest populations\nof people over hundred years old</li>\n<li>Studies of complex systems. These are models to understand the complex interactions\nbetween food, cellular damage and aging. For example, sugars lead to disease but are also a\nvital nutrient for our bodies. Therefore, sugar is not the problem but intake of excessive\nsugar in combination with certain proteins and fats contribute to diseases by activating aging\nrelated genes, creating insulin resistance and triggering excess glucose in the bloodstream!\nOur bodies have an innate ability to regenerate themselves at the cellular and organ levels. But\nmodern diets keep these mechanisms permanently switched off. Leaving us prematurely vulnerable\nto disease and degeneration beginning in our 30s and 40s. According to Dr Longo, our diets should\nbe free of animal proteins except fish.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next book was The Mindspan Diet by Dr Preston Estep, a Harvard PHD in Neuroscience. The\nMindspan Diet explains what to eat to avoid neuro degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s as we age.\nHe suggests that excess iron is the primary cause.</p>\n<p>After world war two there was a shortage of foods rich in iron and this resulted in bread, cereal and\nother foods being fortified with iron. Even today iron-enriched foods are advertised as if the extra\niron is a health benefit! The recommended iron intake is 18 mg/day, but according to Dr Estep we\nshould only be consuming this amount of iron in the first half of our lives during our reproductive\nyears. After age 45 he suggests that 3 mg of iron per day is plenty, and excesses can build up in our\nbrains leading to neuro degeneration.</p>\n<p>Both these books claim that the number one thing you can eat to reduce your healthy lifespan is red\nmeat.</p>\n<p>Finally I learnt a lot from the Finding Ultra book by Rich Roll. Rich Roll is in his early fifties and in\nFinding Ultra he describes his journey from being an Ivy league swimmer to becoming an alcoholic\nand obese before transforming his life to become an ultra-athlete on a plant-powered diet about 12\nyears ago!</p>\n<p>Most fascinating is his Epic 5 feat. An attempt to complete 5 full triathlons in 5 days, each on a\ndifferent Hawaiian island. Arriving late at night on some islands Rich did not have time to prepare\nhis regular plant-based foods. He was forced to eat what he refers to as vegetarian junk food – the\nvegetarian options typically offered by Chinese restaurants. Rich describes the stiffness and muscle\npain he experienced on the days following vegetarian junk food. Amazingly, during the fifth triathlon\nafter having had time to consume his usual plant-based foods the night before Rich describes how\nhe was able to perform with no muscle pain whatsoever and he felt as if it was day one!</p>\n<p>So, since January 2018, I’ve been following a pescatarian diet which is basically vegan plus fish. I’ve\nexperienced new energy levels, lost my afternoon slumps and experience no muscle stiffness even if\nI run 7-days a week!</p>\n<p>Rich Roll states with full confidence that, “An alkaline plant-based wholefood diet is the most rapid\nrecovery tool available to any athlete and a crucial part of his success.”</p>\n<p>I personally experienced proof of this on a recent business trip. I was in Leeds for two nights and on\nthe first night I ate noodles, vegetables and fish. At 6am the next morning, I ran 8-kilometres in 32\nminutes and throughout the first all-day workshop I felt full of energy with no muscle pain\nwhatsoever!</p>\n<p>That evening there was a team building dinner at a Brazilian steakhouse! I did not want to be\nawkward and not eat meat, so like everyone else I ate a fair amount of steak. The next morning, I ran\nthe same 8-k run and around 10 o’clock my muscles started stiffening. By the time I got to the\nairport that evening, I was limping around like and old man!</p>\n<p>This convinced me that I have found what appears to be the best diet for me. That is mostly plant\nbased, organic wherever possible along with the occasional piece of fish. The diet that Dr Longo calls\nThe Longevity Diet.</p>"}},{"node":{"id":"704abc3b-41aa-59e8-8c6b-c8b821397306","frontmatter":{"title":"Presenting The Way We See","date":"23 Apr 2019","video":"ITfB7l1959Y","svg":"/see.png"},"fields":{"slug":"/blogs/20190423-presenting-the-way-we-see/"},"excerpt":"I love to dream.

I also love to read about technology and dream how to apply it to turn my ideas into reality!</p>\n<p>For my work, I have sat through far too many boring presentations. In my determination not to give boring presentations myself, I read several books on how to deliver compelling presentations. Resonate - is a great book by Nancy Duarte that describes how to use contrasts in your storytelling to keep your audience engaged. In storytelling, contrasts often use highs and lows. In visual storytelling, one often contrasts between complex and simple. However, the best presentation book I have ever read and the only book I have ever read twice and keep turning back to is Draw to Win by Dan Roam.</p>\n<p>Dan describes how our brains interpret what we see, which in itself is fascinating to understand!\nWhen our brains see something like this bottle of beer, we interpret it in six steps. The first three steps all happen in parallel (count on fingers). So these three things happen all at once!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We determine who, or what it is we see. In the case of this bottle, we see a bottle of alcohol free beer!</li>\n<li>In parallel, we determine what the impact of this bottle might be. This could be relaxation, getting to know new Toastmaster friends, quenching your thirst or getting home safely whilst still having enjoyed a beer!</li>\n<li>The third piece of parallel processing determines the where or location of this bottle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After these three parallel conclusions, our brains determine three more things but this time in series – one after the other.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Movement – is the bottle moving and at what speed?</li>\n<li>Then we start think of logical causes and effects. If I drink this then how will I feel? If I roll it off the table what will happen?</li>\n<li>Finally, we create a formula to remember what we just saw and what it might mean. Drink it, quench thirst, feel good and get home safely! However, keep upright to avoid the risk of missing these pleasures!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having taught us how our brains interpret what we see, Dan goes on to teach us how we can apply this basic concept of how we see to present anything in an engaging and memorable way!</p>\n<p>Presenting any topic engagingly with just six slides works as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slide 1 - A picture of what it is or who will be impacted</li>\n<li>Slide 2 - How much? What is the impact or benefit of what you are presenting? This might typically be one or two charts.</li>\n<li>Slide 3 - Where does it fit with what I already have or know?</li>\n<li>Slide 4 - A timeline or description of the steps for getting there.</li>\n<li>Slide 5 - A logical flow or cause and effect diagram.</li>\n<li>Slide 6 - A formula. For example, if you do A and B and combine the output with C then you will achieve D.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I started using this approach for my presentations at user conferences and to create YouTube videos that promote our products.\nBesides really enjoying creating presentations in this format, I also received some great feedback from my audiences!</p>\n<p>However, the moment I got really excited was when I was creating a Draw2Win presentation for a new chat bot solution. As I was creating visuals for the six slides, I was asking myself questions like, “Who or what will be impacted?”</p>\n<p>Then lightning struck! What if a chat bot could ask me these questions and apply machine learning, to automatically create compelling visuals for my presentations from my answers? Generative Adversarial Networking, or GAN in sort, is a machine learning technique that can combine images and even videos from a target library to create new videos and images that have the same quality as the original input images! This technique created some of the fake Trump and Obama videos that you may have seen!</p>\n<p>How fantastic would it be, to live in a world without boring bullet-point-slides and where complex subjects can more easily be broken down into easy to understand and engaging visuals? And who knows? One day we might be able to use similar techniques to create compelling talk tracks too and maybe even train avatars that in turn train us on the optimal body language to use to deliver our presentations in the most effective way.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
